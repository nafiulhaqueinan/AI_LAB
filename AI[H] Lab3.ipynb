    "* What is Linear Arrays?\n",
    "> An array is a collection of a fix number of items where all the items are of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arrays consist of :\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Element** - Each item stored in an array is called an element.\n",
    "    * **Index** - Each location of an element in an array has a numerical value, which is used to access its corresponding element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liner Array:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 90 | 100 |\n",
    "| :---|---: | :---|---: | :---|---: | :---\n",
    "Index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | \n",
    "\n",
    "We can declare a liner array (in python a `list`),\n",
    "```py\n",
    "arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This way an adress is created in the memory where the array is stored. We can see the memory location in Python3 with the `id()` and `hex()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `id()` -> prints the memroy adress of an object.  \n",
    "> `hex()` -> converts the memory adress to hexadecimal representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    ">> print(hex(id(arr)))\n",
    "0x7f3bec064ec0\n",
    "```\n",
    "So, whenever we're typing `arr`, we're not actually referencing the array itself. We're referencing a variable that has the reference of the memory location where the array is stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Copying an array\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 ways we can copy arrays in Python:\n",
    "* Simply using the assignment operator\n",
    "* Shallow copy\n",
    "* Deep copy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Assignment Operator\n",
    "We can use `=` to copy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example\n",
    "```py\n",
    "new_arr = old_arr\n",
    "```\n",
    "***Something to remember :***\n",
    "> In python, Assignment statements don't copy objects, they create bindings between a target and an object. When we use `=` operator user may think that this creates a new object which it doesn't. It only creates a new variable that shares the reference of the origianl object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simply put, `new_arr = old_arr` just copy the adress of the `old_arr` to `new_arr`. So, no new array has been created in the memory. These `old_arr` and `new_arr` now points to the same adress in the memory.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "```py\n",
    "arr1 = [2, 6, 9, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prints the address of the arr1 in the memory\n",
    "print(hex(id(arr1)))\n",
    "\n",
    "# assigning arr1 to arr2\n",
    "arr2 = arr1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prints the address of the arr1 in the memory\n",
    "print(hex(id(arr2)))\n",
    "\n",
    "# making a change in arr1\n",
    "arr1[1] = 7\n",
    "\n",
    "# displaying the arrays\n",
    ">> print(arr1)\n",
    ">> print(arr2)\n",
    "0x7f5dcf5d0e80\n",
    "0x7f5dcf5d0e80\n",
    "[2, 7, 9, 4]\n",
    "[2, 7, 9, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "So you see, because the two array shares the same memory address, chaning the value in one array changes the other too.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Sometimes we want to have the original values unchanged and only modify the new values or vice varsa. In Python we can use the other two copy methods which are,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shallow Copy \n",
    "* Deep Copy\n",
    "\n",
    "**To make these copy work, we use the `copy` module.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shallow Copy\n",
    "> A shallow copy creates a new object which stores the refernce of the original elements. So, a shallow copy doesn't just copies the reference of nested objects. This means a copy process doesn't recurse or create copies of nested object itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In other words, a shallow copy can copy a normal list / array and store that in a different memory space. However, if the list is a nested list, the shallow copy method will only copy the whole list in a another memory location, however, it will not copy nested list objects. Instead it'll create the reference of origianl memory for the nested items.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For better understanding this, let's see an example,\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "old_list = [1,2,3,4]\n",
    "new_list = copy.copy(old_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "new_list.append(5)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Old list: {old_list}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Old list memory location: {hex(id(old_list))}\")\n",
    "print(f\"New list: {new_list}\")\n",
    "print(f\"New list memory location: {hex(id(new_list))}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "After running the program, we'll get,\n",
    "\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "Old list: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "Old list memory location: 0x7f42452b8e00\n",
    "New list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "New list memory location: 0x7f42452b8480\n",
    "```\n",
    "So, with this method we can `copy` a list in python. However, this only **really** works with normal lists. We'll get into problems if we use this method to copy nested lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "old_list = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]\n",
    "new_list = copy.copy(old_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "new_list[0] = ['a','b','c']\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Old list: {old_list}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Old list memory location: {hex(id(old_list))}\")\n",
    "print(f\"New list: {new_list}\")\n",
    "print(f\"New list memory location: {hex(id(new_list))}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "Old list: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "Old list memory location: 0x7f7df913c800\n",
    "New list: [['a', 'b', 'c'], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "New list memory location: 0x7f7df913c580\n",
    "```\n",
    "This works fine. Now, let's see what happens if we change the nested list objects inside the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "old_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "new_list = copy.copy(old_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "new_list[0][0] = \"a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Old list: {old_list}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Old list memory location: {hex(id(old_list))}\")\n",
    "print(f\"New list: {new_list}\")\n",
    "print(f\"New list memory location: {hex(id(new_list))}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "Old list: [['a', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "Old list memory location: 0x7ff49810f900\n",
    "New list: [['a', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "New list memory location: 0x7ff49810f680\n",
    "```\n",
    "`old_list` and `new_list` both changes. This happen because, the `shallow copy` method only copy the whole list in a new memory but it doesn't touch the nested list objects. Instead it creates a reference of the original memory location for them. That is why when we change only the whole list the changes happen in only the new list not both. However, when we touch the nested list objects, changes happen in both the new and the old lists. So, this is `Shallow Copy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In case anyone wandering about `list.copy()` method, Yes, that is a shallow copy method too.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you're still confused read this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17246693/what-is-the-difference-between-shallow-copy-deepcopy-and-normal-assignment-oper) from stackoverflow.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Copy\n",
    "\n",
    "> A deep copy creates a new object and recursively adds the copies of nested objects present in the original elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deepcopy solves the problem we had with the nested list with the shallow copy. Let's now apply deep copy method with the nested list example we just used earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "old_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "new_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "new_list[0][0] = \"a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Old list: {old_list}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Old list memory location: {hex(id(old_list))}\")\n",
    "print(f\"New list: {new_list}\")\n",
    "print(f\"New list memory location: {hex(id(new_list))}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "Old list: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "Old list memory location: 0x7fea699b4880\n",
    "New list: [['a', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "New list memory location: 0x7fea699b4600\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, using the `deepcopy()` we've solved the problem here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Something to remember :***\n",
    "> Although in python we can change the array / list size anytime, however, in other programming languages such as C++ or Java, the size is fixed from the get go. So, in this course for learning purposes we'll always fix the size of the arrays / list from the get go too. It'll help us understand thigs more easily. For example,\n",

    "```py\n",
    ">> arr = [0] * 10\n",
